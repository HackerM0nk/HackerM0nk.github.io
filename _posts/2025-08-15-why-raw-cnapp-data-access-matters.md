Security today is as much about **data operations** as it is about firewalls or policies. CNAPP platforms (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms) collect an enormous volume of telemetry from cloud environments — configurations, vulnerabilities, API calls, identity mappings, runtime events.

Most teams consume this through the vendor’s UI, pre-built dashboards, and canned alerts. While useful, this often leaves the most valuable capability underused: **direct access to the raw data**.

## Advantages of Having Raw CNAPP Data

### 1. **Custom Querying for Unique Threat Models**

Every company has its own risk profile. By pulling raw CNAPP data into a warehouse like **Snowflake** or a data lake, you can write **queries that match your environment**, not a generic template.

* Correlate IAM changes with high-risk resource exposure.
* Detect drift in security groups tied to sensitive workloads.
* Identify unusual API patterns across multiple accounts.

> At Sprinklr, Lacework pushes enriched event data into Snowflake, and our security team writes targeted SQL to surface issues specific to our platforms — things the out-of-the-box dashboards might not even consider.

---

### 2. **Cost-Effective at Multi-Cloud Scale**

Multi-cloud environments make licensing **painfully expensive** — you often pay per account, per region, or per data volume, **even when you’re storing the same type of telemetry twice**.

* **Warehouse economics**: Store once in Snowflake/BigQuery, query many times.
* **Vendor UI avoidance**: Skip the seat-based or feature-tier pricing traps that lock critical capabilities behind “enterprise” SKUs.
* **Consolidated views**: Instead of flipping between dashboards for AWS, Azure, and GCP, unify them in one query layer.

---

### 3. **Faster Compliance Point-Fixes**

Certain compliance violations — like open S3 buckets, unencrypted databases, or missing IAM MFA — need to be fixed **as soon as they’re detected** to avoid audit failure or regulatory exposure.

* With raw data, you can **instantly search** for all instances across accounts.
* Run **ad-hoc scripts** to push fixes.
* Document remediation steps for auditors in real time.

With this approach, a point-fix script can be executed immediately — no waiting for the vendor’s UI refresh cycle.

---

### 4. **Breach & Alert Response**

When a security breach or critical alert comes in, speed matters:

* **Query the full dataset**, not just the subset a dashboard shows.
* Trace lateral movement by joining logs across services.
* Identify and revoke risky identities in minutes, not hours.

This turns the CNAPP from a slow “alert feed” into a real-time investigation engine.

## The “What If” Scenario — Open-Source CNAPP Orchestration

Could we have an **open-source CNAPP orchestration framework** that:

* Ingests security data from multiple SaaS APIs and logs.
* Normalizes it into a central warehouse/lake.
* Provides a query layer and basic dashboards.
* Lets you plug in ML models or detection logic.

This could combine:

* **Security Lake architectures** (AWS Security Lake, GCP Chronicle).
* **ETL tooling** (Airbyte, dbt, Apache NiFi).
* **Visualization** (Superset, Metabase, Grafana).

And crucially — no vendor UI lock-in.

## Closing Thoughts

Security vendors often say *“security is about data”*, but in practice, **it’s about what you can *do* with that data**. Raw CNAPP exports let your team:

* Cut costs in multi-cloud licensing.
* Respond to compliance violations immediately.
* Investigate breaches with full context.

At Sprinklr, our experience has been clear: owning our query layer lets us move faster, fix more precisely, and ask better questions. The next evolution could be a more **open, interoperable, community-driven CNAPP pipeline** — one where every security team has both the raw ingredients and the kitchen to cook their own insights.
