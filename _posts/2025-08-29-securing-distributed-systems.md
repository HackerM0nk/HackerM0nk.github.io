## 1) Why we distribute at all

We split a system into pieces for four honest reasons: **scale** (one box can’t handle it), **latency** (keep work close to users and data), **team autonomy** (small teams ship without stepping on each other), and **fault isolation** (a crack in one tile shouldn’t shatter the floor). Each reason adds **hops**. Every hop is a **contract**. And every contract needs the same six things: **identity**, **validation**, **limits**, **least privilege**, **encryption**, and **observability**. Hold on to that mantra—we’ll use it at each layer.

---

## 2) Edge & CDN

**Why it exists.** This is your moat and drawbridge. It absorbs bursts, terminates TLS, caches safe responses, and lets you run tiny policies right where users land.

**How it fails.** Private pages get cached under loose keys; TLS/HSTS is misconfigured; a “catch-all WAF” blocks nothing important and everything annoying; rate limits only exist on paper.

**Secure by design.** Turn on modern TLS with **HSTS** and automate cert rotation. Treat the CDN as a **validator**: schema checks for basic inputs, strict media types, and **signed cookies/URLs** for downloads. Build cache keys that include **auth variant, locale, device** so user-specific data never bleeds.

**How you’ll know.** Watch 4xx/5xx by **path**, track **WAF rule families** (are they doing real work?), and alarm on sudden bursts from a single ASN/IP range. Review false-positives weekly, not “someday”.

---

## 3) API Gateway & Protocols

**Why it exists.** It’s the contract desk. You centralize cross-cutting rules—versioning, schema, auth, rate limits—so every service doesn’t reinvent them.

**How it fails.** Deserialization bugs, version skew between client and server, “internal” routes that quietly go public, and payloads that allow **over-posting** (you accepted fields you never meant to).

**Secure by design.** Enforce **OpenAPI/JSON-Schema/Protobuf** with **unknown-field rejection**. Set **size/time limits** and use consistent error shapes (no stack traces in production). Validate **OIDC/OAuth** tokens for issuer/audience with short lifetimes. Start from **deny by default** and explicitly allow operations.

**How you’ll know.** Slice metrics by **route + version**. Add contract tests in CI that fail builds when behavior drifts from the spec.

---

## 4) Identity & Service-to-Service Trust

**Why it exists.** Every actor—humans, services, and scheduled jobs—needs a **provable** and **scoped** identity.

**How it fails.** Long-lived secrets get copied; tokens are replayed to the wrong audience; “internal-only” calls ride plaintext; someone sneaks in without **mTLS**.

**Secure by design.** Users authenticate with OIDC at the edge. Services authenticate with **mTLS** (SPIFFE/SPIRE or a managed mesh). Give every service a narrowly scoped account and put authorization behind a **policy engine** (RBAC/ABAC/OPA) with local decision caching. Rotate everything; publish rotation events.

**How you’ll know.** Alert on token reuse from new geo/IP, on failed mTLS handshakes, and on policy decisions (who/what/object/result) that suddenly spike.

---

## 5) Services & Decomposition

**Why it exists.** Smaller, well-named boxes have smaller blast radii and clearer ownership.

**How it fails.** Classic **IDOR/BOLA**: code fetches an object by ID but never checks **who** asked. Confused-deputy patterns sneak in. A simple call turns into accidental **fan-out** across ten services.

**Secure by design.** Make authorization **object-centric**: `can(subject, action, objectId)` on every read/write. Lock down DTOs with **allowlists**. Require **idempotency** for mutations so retries don’t double-charge. “Deny by default” means no silent fall-through to admin.

**How you’ll know.** Log decisions by **object** and hunt for outliers (one user reading 10× their usual tenant count). Meter fan-out and N+1 queries.

---

## 6) Resilience Patterns

**Why it exists.** Networks drop, timeouts happen, and retries create duplicates. That’s life.

**How it fails.** Unbounded retries create a **self-DDoS**. Side effects repeat (double refunds). Partial failures corrupt state and nobody notices until month-end.

**Secure by design.** Put **timeouts** everywhere. Use **bounded retries** with **exponential backoff + jitter**. Treat idempotency as a feature, not a hope. Use circuit breakers and bulkheads so things fail **quietly**.

**How you’ll know.** Monitor breaker open rates, retry counters, and duplicate-write detectors. Tie deploys to **SLO budgets** so you don’t ship into a screaming system.

---

## 7) State & Storage

**Why it exists.** It’s the source of truth: tables, indexes, search, backups.

**How it fails.** Injection sneaks in through string-built queries. Tenants collide in the same tables. “Delete” only hides rows. Snapshots wander into public buckets.

**Secure by design.** Ban string-built SQL in CI and only allow **parameterized queries**. Use per-service DB users with **least privilege** and network isolation. Pull secrets from a manager at runtime, not env files. Encrypt at rest with per-tenant keys when required (**BYOK/CMK**) and support **crypto-shredding** for erasure. Enforce tenant binding via **row-level security** or app guards that inject the tenant filter.

**How you’ll know.** Turn on audit logs for sensitive tables. Alarm on replication drift. Run **restore drills**—a backup you can’t restore is theater.

---

## 8) Caching

**Why it exists.** Latency and cost. Edge, gateway, and data-layer caches save you trips.

**How it fails.** Cache poisoning, key collisions between tenants, stale permissions, and the infamous open Redis.

**Secure by design.** Namespaced keys (`tenant:user:version`). Short TTLs or **event-driven invalidation** for authorization decisions. Require TLS and authentication to caches.

**How you’ll know.** Watch hit/miss by **principal**. Alert on invalidation failures and weird flips from 403 to 200.

---

## 9) Messaging (Queues & Streams)

**Why it exists.** You decouple producers and consumers, smooth load, and preserve order where needed.

**How it fails.** Poison messages clog consumers. Old messages get replayed as if they were new. Schemas drift and nobody told the reader. A curious service subscribes to a topic it shouldn’t.

**Secure by design.** Enforce per-topic **AuthN/Z** and separate producer from consumer scopes. Publish through a **schema registry** with compatibility checks. Make consumers **idempotent** and use dead-letter queues with quarantine. Encrypt sensitive fields; headers aren’t private.

**How you’ll know.** Alert on DLQ growth and consumer lag. Track producer identities. Highlight schema-version anomalies.

---

## 10) Event Workflows & Sagas

**Why it exists.** Real work spans services. Sagas coordinate steps and compensations without heavy 2PC.

**How it fails.** Orphaned state after a mid-way crash. Compensations that “sort of” reverse side effects. Replay of stale events. Double shipping or double refunding in the chaos.

**Secure by design.** Model **explicit state machines**. Make every step and compensation **idempotent**. **Sign events** and attach nonces/timestamps; bound retention so ancient events don’t come back. Re-authorize **each step**; don’t trust the original auth forever.

**How you’ll know.** Time out stuck sagas, graph compensation spikes, and sweep for orphans on a schedule.

---

## 11) Schedulers & Batch

**Why it exists.** Compaction, billing, reindexing, and ML features—they all run on the quiet backbone.

**How it fails.** A cron job with god-mode credentials, fan-out that floods downstreams, secrets baked into images, and month-end stampedes.

**Secure by design.** Give each job a **dedicated identity** with least privilege. Cap concurrency, add backoff, and keep **kill switches** handy. Inject secrets at runtime and favor short-lived tokens.

**How you’ll know.** Alert on missed runs and runtime variance. Keep per-job audit trails.

---

## 12) Config, Secrets & Feature Flags

**Why it exists.** Change behavior fast and keep secrets out of code.

**How it fails.** Secrets in git or plaintext env. “Read everything” policies. Flags default to unsafe and get flipped by accident.

**Secure by design.** Store secrets centrally with per-service paths and **encryption in transit/at rest**. Fetch **just-in-time**; rotate often; cache with care. Flags should **default safe**, roll out per tenant or cohort, and always have **kill switches**.

**How you’ll know.** Monitor secret access by principal. Audit every flag change. Watch for traffic spikes right after flips.

---

## 13) Orchestration & Runtime (Kubernetes, etc.)

**Why it exists.** Schedule, isolate, patch, and observe containers at scale.

**How it fails.** Privileged pods, unsigned images, flat east-west networks, and admission control that’s there but toothless.

**Secure by design.** Require **signed images + SBOMs** and verify them at admission. Drop root and capabilities, use read-only FS, and enable seccomp/AppArmor. Add **network policies** plus pod-to-pod **mTLS**. Keep service accounts narrow. Standardize **golden base images** and patch quickly.

**How you’ll know.** Break down admission denials by reason, alert on unsigned image attempts, and watch for namespace/node anomalies.

---

## 14) Multi-Region & Disaster Recovery

**Why it exists.** You want to survive AZ hiccups, region events, and maybe meet latency goals across continents.

**How it fails.** Authentication fails **open** during failover. Data sloshes across borders. Configurations drift between regions and never converge.

**Secure by design.** Write down **RTO/RPO** and drill them like incidents. Use **region-scoped keys**, encrypt replication, and enforce residency for regulated data. Route by health but with guardrails. Never fail auth **open**.

**How you’ll know.** Alert on cross-region data movement. Treat DR exercises like real incidents and track findings to closure. Run continuous **config-drift** checks.

---

## 15) Data Pipelines & Analytics

**Why it exists.** ETL/ELT for BI and ML, feature stores, and compliance reporting—that’s your “second system”.

**How it fails.** PII sprawls into raw zones and notebooks. Buckets go public “for a minute”. “Temp.csv” becomes permanent. Over-wide sharing allows accidental re-identification.

**Secure by design.** Start with **data contracts** and lineage. Tag sensitivity at the **source**. Mask/tokenize in raw zones. Use **row-level security** and **time-boxed access**. For regulated zones, enforce BYOK/CMK. Sign exports and add quality gates (schema/null/range) to catch garbage early.

**How you’ll know.** Track dataset access anomalies, keep export audit trails, and alert on lineage diffs when upstreams change.

---

## 16) Supply Chain & CI/CD

**Why it exists.** Build once, prove provenance, deploy safely.

**How it fails.** Dependency confusion, typosquatted packages, malicious PRs, tampered artifacts, and leaked runner creds.

**Secure by design.** Gate merges with SAST/SCA/secret scanning. Pin dependencies or use allowlists. Produce **provenance attestations** (SLSA-style) and verify them at deploy. Separate **build** from **deploy** credentials. Protect environments and add manual gates for risky changes.

**How you’ll know.** Track attestation verification rates, subscribe to dependency anomaly feeds, and monitor runner/registry access like a hawk.

---

## 17) Observability & Detections

**Why it exists.** You can’t defend what you can’t see, but you also don’t want to drown in noise.

**How it fails.** Logs carry PII. Traces leak tokens. Dashboards are open to the internet. Retention grows without purpose.

**Secure by design.** Use **structured logs** with scrubbing. Never put secrets in traces. Sample with intent. Tag traces with tenant/subject. Lock dashboards by role and set finite retention. Add **eBPF-based** runtime sensors for syscall/network insight, but keep their privileges minimal and rules high-signal.

**How you’ll know.** Alert on PII scanner hits, dashboard access anomalies, and review detection precision/recall. Measure MTTR for contain/eradicate and test safe auto-isolation.

---

## 18) Compliance & Data Handling

**Why it exists.** Laws, contracts, and trust—from privacy regulations to enterprise commitments.

**How it fails.** “Delete” doesn’t actually delete. Keys exist but aren’t governed. Data leaves its allowed residence.

**Secure by design.** Map **classification → controls**. Record lawful bases. Use BYOK/CMK and **field-level encryption** for sensitive attributes. Support **crypto-shredding** (drop keys to erase). Tie continuous compliance to **code, infra, and runtime evidence** so audits read like engineering, not theater.

**How you’ll know.** Log key usage and rotation. Produce deletion proofs. Alert on residency drift. Keep auditor-readable reports ready.

---

## 19) How to start on Monday

1) **Trace one user action** end-to-end. Draw every hop: edge → gateway → service → queue → DB → analytics.  
2) **Mark trust boundaries** where identity, protocol, or storage changes.  
3) **Write invariants per boundary:** identity proven, schema validated, least-privileged, encrypted, rate-/cost-limited, observable.  
4) **Enforce in code and config**—admissions, policies, CI tests—not just in a policy doc.  
5) **Detect drift** with metrics, logs, tests, and admission controllers.  
6) **Practice failure and recovery**: timeouts, idempotency, circuit breakers, runbooks, and DR drills.

---

## 20) Cheat-sheet: boundary invariants

- **Identity:** every caller is known (user/service/job), scoped, and short-lived.  
- **Validation:** inputs match a schema; **unknown fields are rejected**; size/time boxed.  
- **Limits:** rate, cost, and concurrency caps; retries bounded with **jitter**.  
- **Least privilege:** narrow network reach, data scope, and action rights by default.  
- **Encryption:** always in transit; at rest where meaningful; keys governed (BYOK/CMK).  
- **Observability:** structured events that link **subject, action, object, and decision**—without leaking secrets.

---

### A quick threat-model checklist

- **Assets**: What’s the data of consequence? Who depends on which invariants?  
- **Actors**: Humans, services, jobs, and their scopes.  
- **Entry points**: Edge, APIs, message topics, admin planes, CI pipelines.  
- **Trust boundaries**: Every place identity or authority changes.  
- **Abuse cases**: How would *you* cheat your own system?  
- **Controls**: Prevent, limit blast radius, detect fast, recover safely.  
- **Evidence**: Can you *prove* a controlled run, and see when it drifted?

### Closing thought

Distributed systems are **a lot of small promises** traveling over unreliable networks. Security is the habit of making those promises explicit and enforceable. If you bind **identity** to **action**, validate with intent, limit by default, encrypt by habit, and observe on purpose, you’ll ship systems that not only scale—but **age well**.
