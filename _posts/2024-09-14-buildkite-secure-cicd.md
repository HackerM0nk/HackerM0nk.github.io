## Security Features

This project implements a comprehensive **security-first approach** with multiple layers of automated security checks:

### **üîç Static Analysis & Scanning**
- **Secret Scanning**: Gitleaks integration to prevent credential leaks
- **SAST**: Semgrep for static application security testing
- **SCA**: OSV for software composition analysis and vulnerability detection
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy for Docker image vulnerability assessment

### **üõ°Ô∏è Supply Chain Security**
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials using Syft and Trivy
- **Cryptographic Signing**: Cosign for container image signing
- **Reproducible Builds**: Consistent, verifiable deployment artifacts

### **üìã Security Pipeline Integration**
- All security checks integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Automated blocking on security violations
- Comprehensive reporting and logging

---

## Key Design Decisions

### **üöÄ No External Registry Approach**
- Eliminates external dependencies for local development
- Fully self-contained deployment pipeline
- Reduced attack surface and improved security posture

### **‚ôªÔ∏è Reproducible Local Demos**
- Complete environment setup automation
- Consistent deployment across different systems
- Easy onboarding for team members and stakeholders

### **üîß Production-Ready Patterns**
- Industry best practices implementation
- Scalable architecture design
- Monitoring and observability considerations
