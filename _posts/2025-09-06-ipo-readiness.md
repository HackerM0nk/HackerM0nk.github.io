> *Context*: A VP of Platform Engineering asked, “How do we make our platform **IPO-ready**—fast, without fluff?”  
> This is the blueprint I’d implement for a stack with **React and React Native clients**, **Express on Node** APIs on **ECS** in private subnets, **EKS** hosting FOSS middleware, **MongoDB and RDS**, and **data pipelines on EMR, dbt, Snowflake**. Inter-service payloads are **JSON** via load balancer target groups, **no mesh**.

---

## TL;DR

- **Contract before code:** OpenAPI as truth, validate **requests and responses**, tag PII, enforce from gateway and service.
- **Least privilege by default:** CORS allowlist, strict headers, short-lived signed URLs, owner checks on every resource.
- **Find what hunters find—first:** FOSS-first pipeline for recon → scanners → mobile analysis → cloud posture → runtime → dark-web feeds → **Snowflake + dbt** → Jira/Slack.
- **Pre-IPO 7-day hardening:** freeze risky changes, WAF in block mode, secrets sweep and rotations, mobile pinning, top-20 IDOR pass, surge triage desk.

---

## 1) The Surface You’re Securing

- **Clients:** React web; Android in Java or Kotlin; iOS in Swift; React Native UI.
- **APIs:** Express on Node, JSON over HTTP; service discovery via LB target groups.
- **Runtime:** ECS in private subnets for APIs; EKS runs FOSS middleware for logging, monitoring, alerting, message queues, caches; a few standalone servers.
- **Data:** MongoDB and Amazon RDS.
- **Data Eng and Science:** EMR, dbt, Snowflake, Python jobs.
- **Inter-service:** JSON only, no gRPC or Avro.

**What hunters probe first**

* **Web and APIs:** IDOR or BOLA, weak JWT validation, OTP and login abuse, NoSQLi on Mongo, SQLi on RDS, S3 signed URL misuse.
* **Mobile:** reverse-engineering to extract endpoints and flags, pinning bypass, exported component abuse.
* **Middleware:** exposed dashboards, unauth Redis or Kafka, replay and poison-pill messages.
* **Data:** over-broad responses, long-lived signed URLs, missing field projections.

## 3) Controls That Actually Move Risk

### Edge and gateway

* **WAF in block mode**, route-specific rate limits for login, OTP, reset; geo and ASN throttles.
* **CORS allowlist**, **HSTS**, **CSP with nonce**, **Referrer-Policy**, **Permissions-Policy**.
* **HMAC plus timestamp** on inbound webhooks, tight replay window, clock skew controls.

### APIs and authorization

* Central **owner check** for BOLA and IDOR; required in PRs and tests.
* JWT hygiene: verify **iss aud exp nbf**, rotate keys, pin JWKs, mTLS inside VPC.
* **Idempotency keys** for writes; reject replays.
* **Request and response validation** from OpenAPI; strip unknown fields by default.
* **File uploads:** size caps, MIME sniff plus allowlist, AV scan, **re-encode images**, signed URLs bound to content type and short TTL.

### Mobile

* **TLS pinning** with a rotation plan; no secrets in apps; secure keychain or keystore.
* Restrict **exported components** and URL handlers; safe WebView defaults.
* **Replay-safe OTP** and device velocity checks; proper logout and token revocation.

### Event-driven and middleware

* Redis or Kafka with **TLS and auth**, per-topic ACLs, **schema validation** even for JSON, dedupe keys, secured DLQs and retention.
* No public ingress to dashboards; SSO plus network ACLs; PII-safe logs and metrics.

### Data layer

* Response **field allowlists** and strict projections; deny additional fields.
* NoSQLi and SQLi hardening: safe builders, disallow Mongo operators like `$where` and `$regex` from user input.
* **Short TTL signed URLs**; bind to content type and size; single-use where possible.
* Encrypted backups, restore-tested; document the **crypto-shred** path for deletions.

### Cloud and EKS

* **IMDSv2** only; **IRSA** for pods; no static cloud keys in CI.
* Admission policies: no root, read-only filesystem, drop caps, seccomp, AppArmor.
* **Image signing and SBOMs**; block unscanned or unsigned images.
* **Egress allowlists** through NAT or proxy to limit exfil paths.

## 4) Automation: Beat the Hunters With Telemetry

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant BH as Bug hunter
  participant Recon as Recon subfinder amass httpx naabu
  participant Scan as Scanners nuclei ZAP
  participant Edge as WAF ALB
  participant API as Gateway APIs
  participant Snow as Snowflake dbt marts
  participant Triage as Jira Slack

  BH->>Recon: enumerate subdomains ports certs
  Recon-->>Scan: alive hosts and paths
  Scan->>Edge: probe endpoints IDOR OTP abuse
  Edge-->>Scan: rate limits and blocks with logs
  Scan-->>API: report findings if any
  API-->>Snow: access logs schema drift auth spikes
  Scan-->>Snow: scanner results json
  Snow-->>Triage: high risk alerts owner mapped runbooks linked
```

**Collectors FOSS-first:** subfinder, amass, httpx, naabu, nuclei, OWASP ZAP headless, MobSF, gitleaks, trufflehog, Prowler, kube-bench, Falco, Trivy, Checkov.
**Paid where it helps:** Censys or Shodan for exposure, SpyCloud or Constella for breach matches, a CNAPP if already adopted.
**Normalize → Model:** land JSON to S3 → **Snowflake** → **dbt** marts: *Attack Surface*, *PII Drift*, *Leak Watch*, *Auth Abuse*.
**Triage:** auto-assign by service map, deduplicate, SLA timers, Slack and Jira with runbooks.

## 5) Secure Defaults You Can Drop In Today

**Express baseline**

```ts
// app.ts
app.use(securityHeaders({ cspNonce: true, hsts: true, referrer: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin' }));
app.use(authn());                           // verify iss aud exp nbf, rotate keys
app.use(rateLimitPerRoute());               // tighter RPS for login, OTP, reset
app.use(validateRequestFromOpenAPI());      // ajv schemas for inputs
app.use(corsAllowlist());                   // strict origins and methods
app.use(idempotencyForWrites());            // reject replays with Idempotency-Key
app.use(piiRedactingLogger());              // structured logs without PII
// handlers...
app.use(validateResponseFromOpenAPI());     // block accidental over-exposure
```

**OpenAPI response allowlisting**

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    UserProfile:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          x-data-classification: internal_id
        email:
          type: string
          format: email
          x-data-classification: pii
      additionalProperties: false
```

**File uploads**
Size caps, MIME sniff plus allowlist, AV scan, **re-encode images**, short-TTL signed URLs bound to content type and hash.

**Queues and events**
Auth and TLS on Redis or Kafka, per-topic ACLs, **schema validation** for JSON, dedupe keys, DLQ ACLs and PII scrubbing.

## 6) Dark-Web and Credential Leak Auto-Reset

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant Feeds as HIBP DeHashed SpyCloud
  participant Norm as Normalizer
  participant Dir as Directory employees providers
  participant IdP as SSO MFA
  participant Jira as Jira On call

  Feeds-->>Norm: leaked email hash breach source timestamp
  Norm->>Dir: fuzzy match emails
  Dir-->>Norm: user ids
  Norm->>IdP: force reset revoke tokens
  IdP-->>Jira: ticket notify user audit trail
```

**Why it matters:** credential stuffing is cheap and fast. If an employee or privileged user reuses a breached password, you want the reset **before** anyone probes your perimeter.

---

## 7) Pre-IPO Seven-Day Hardening Plan

* **Day 0–1**: Freeze risky internet-facing changes. WAF to **block** for OWASP rules. Tight rate limits on login, OTP, reset. Enable **HSTS** and strict **CSP**. Review CORS.
* **Day 1–2**: Exposure sweep with Censys or Shodan plus security group audits. Close **all dashboards** from the internet. S3 public audit. Verify Redis and Kafka **TLS and auth**.
* **Day 2–3**: Org-wide secret scans and rotations. Revoke unused OAuth apps. Enforce **MFA** everywhere.
* **Day 3–4**: Mobile pass—MobSF clean, pinning verified, release flags only, remove debug toggles.
* **Day 4–5**: **IDOR pass** on top 20 endpoints for bookings, payments, addresses, profiles. Add missing owner checks and tests.
* **Day 5–6**: Bug-bounty **surge desk**: on-call rota, pre-approved hotfix playbook, comms templates, takedown decision tree.
* **Day 6–7**: Red-team smoke tests. Final dashboards. Exec readout: risk register with owners and dates.

---

## 8) PR Template and SLAs

**PR checklist for internet-facing changes**

* [ ] AuthZ explicit and tested with owner checks
* [ ] Per-route rate limit and idempotency where relevant
* [ ] Request **and response** validated against OpenAPI
* [ ] No secrets in code or logs
* [ ] PII fields reviewed and masked where needed
* [ ] File handling safe: MIME, size, AV, re-encode
* [ ] No new public ingress or dashboards

**SLAs:** Critical 24h • High 3d • Medium 7d. Every alert links to a **runbook** with reproduction and safe rollback.

---

## 9) What We Track

* **External exposure:** new open ports or domains versus baseline → page on call if critical.
* **PII drift:** responses returning fields **not** in the spec.
* **Auth abuse:** login or OTP failure spikes by IP and ASN; geo anomalies.
* **Leak watch:** new employee matches in breach feeds and reset status.
* **Mobile risk:** top MobSF issues by app version.

---

## Closing

IPO-ready security is not a tooling contest. It is **good defaults** plus **honest telemetry**: contracts that prevent over-sharing, controls that limit blast radius, and a pipeline that shows drift the moment it appears. Ship that, and you stay ahead of hunters—and your engineers keep shipping with confidence.
