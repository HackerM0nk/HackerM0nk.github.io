title: "IPO-Ready Security: A Practical Playbook for VPs of Platform Engineering"
date: 2025-09-06
tags: \[security, platform, devsecops, IPO, cloud, mobile]
summary: A concise, technically detailed strategy to harden web, mobile, APIs, and cloud—built for a soon-to-IPO company with Node on ECS, middleware on EKS, MongoDB and RDS, React and React Native clients.

> *Context:* A VP of Platform Engineering asked, “What does **IPO-ready security** look like, end-to-end?”
> This post is my practical answer—what I’d recommend and implement, distilled from prior hands-on experience in a very similar stack.

## TL;DR

**Make the secure path the default** and wire a **FOSS-first automation pipeline** that finds what bug hunters would—**before** they do.

1. **Edge & Contracts**: WAF in block mode, strict CORS, CSP, rate limits, OpenAPI as security contract with request **and response** validation.
2. **AuthZ & IDOR**: Central, testable **owner checks** on every resource access. JWT hygiene. Idempotency for all writes.
3. **Mobile hygiene**: TLS pinning, no secrets in apps, secure storage, release-only flags, webview guardrails.
4. **Cloud & Runtime**: IMDSv2, least-privilege IAM, admission policies, signed images, Falco runtime, egress allowlists.
5. **Leak watch**: Continuous breach monitoring for employee creds with **auto-reset** and token revocation.
6. **Automation**: Recon → scanners → mobile analysis → cloud posture → runtime → dark-web feeds → **Snowflake + dbt** → Jira/Slack with runbooks.
7. **7-Day Hardening**: A short, aggressive checklist to stabilize public surfaces pre-IPO.

---

## 1) The Stack We’re Securing

* **Clients**: Web app in React; Mobile apps for Android (Java or Kotlin), iOS (Swift), plus React Native.
* **APIs**: Express on Node, JSON over HTTP, service discovery via LB target groups, no mesh.
* **Runtime**: Node microservices on **ECS in private subnets**; **EKS** runs FOSS middleware (logging, monitoring, alerting, message queues, caching). A few standalone servers exist.
* **Data**: MongoDB and Amazon RDS.
* **Data Eng/Science**: EMR, dbt, Snowflake, Python workloads.
* **Inter-service**: JSON payloads only (no gRPC or Avro).

---

## 2) Design Principles

* **Contract before code**: OpenAPI as the source of truth, with **req+resp validation** and PII tagging.
* **Deny by default**: Tight CORS, strict headers, field-level response allowlists, short-lived signed URLs.
* **Shift-left + log-right**: Lint/spec diffs, secrets scans, IaC checks in CI; rich logs and metrics into Snowflake for correlation.
* **Evidence-driven**: Dashboards for exposure, PII drift, auth abuse, and leak watch; SLAs and runbooks wired to alerts.
* **FOSS-first**: Use battle-tested open source where possible; layer paid tools only where they give time-to-value.

## 4) How Hunters Try To Break You (and How We Block It)

**Web & APIs**

* **BOLA/IDOR**: attacker fetches a different user’s resource using guessed IDs.

  * *Block*: central `ownerCheck(subject, resourceOwner)` helper enforced in PRs + tests.
* **Auth flaws**: weak JWT checks or refresh flows.

  * *Block*: verify `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, `nbf`, rotate signing keys, pin JWKs, mTLS inside VPC.
* **Abuse**: OTP brute-force, password reset abuse, credential stuffing.

  * *Block*: route-specific rate limits, IP and ASN throttles, device velocity rules, breach-password checks.
* **Input vulns**: NoSQLi in Mongo (`$where`, `$regex`), SQLi in RDS, prototype pollution.

  * *Block*: safe query builders, deny Mongo operators in user input, schema validation for req+resp.

**Mobile**

* Reverse engineering to extract endpoints, feature flags, secrets.

  * *Block*: **no secrets in apps**, TLS pinning, secure keystore/keychain, restrict exported components and URL handlers.

**Infra & Middleware**

* Exposed dashboards, unauth Redis or Kafka, replay and poison-pill messages.

  * *Block*: SSO plus network ACLs, TLS and auth on brokers, per-topic ACLs, schema validation even for JSON, DLQ ACLs.

**Data**

* Over-broad responses, long-lived signed URLs, missing field projections.

  * *Block*: allowlisted response fields, short-TTL signed URLs bound to content type and size, AV scan and re-encode uploads.

## 5) The Automation Pipeline

**Goal:** discover what external hunters would—**first**—and turn it into tickets and dashboards.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant BH as Bug hunter
  participant Recon as Recon subfinder amass httpx
  participant Scan as Scanners nuclei ZAP
  participant Edge as WAF ALB
  participant API as Gateway APIs
  participant Snow as Snowflake dbt marts
  participant Triage as Jira Slack

  BH->>Recon: enumerate subdomains ports certs
  Recon-->>Scan: alive hosts and paths
  Scan->>Edge: probe endpoints IDOR OTP abuse
  Edge-->>Scan: rate limits and blocks with logs
  Scan-->>API: report findings
  API-->>Snow: access logs schema drift auth spikes
  Scan-->>Snow: scanner results json
  Snow-->>Triage: high risk alerts owner mapped runbooks linked
```

**Collectors (FOSS-first):** subfinder, amass, httpx, naabu, nuclei, ZAP headless, MobSF, gitleaks, trufflehog, Prowler, kube-bench, Falco, Trivy, Checkov.
**Paid where it helps:** Censys or Shodan, SpyCloud or Constella, a cloud CNAPP if you already run one.
**Store & Model:** land JSON into S3 → **Snowflake** → **dbt** marts: *Attack Surface*, *PII Drift*, *Leak Watch*, *Auth Abuse*.
**Triage:** auto-assign to owning squad (service→LB→ECS task), dedup, SLA timers, Slack + Jira.

## 6) Secure Defaults You Can Drop In

**Express middleware baseline**

```ts
// app.ts
app.use(securityHeaders({ cspNonce: true, hsts: true, referrer: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin' }));
app.use(authn());                           // verify JWT iss aud exp nbf
app.use(rateLimitPerRoute());               // sensitive routes get tighter RPS
app.use(validateRequestFromOpenAPI());      // ajv with schemas
app.use(corsAllowlist());                   // strict origins and methods
app.use(idempotencyForWrites());            // reject replays
app.use(piiRedactingLogger());              // no secrets or PII in logs
// handlers...
app.use(validateResponseFromOpenAPI());     // block accidental over-exposure
```

**Response allowlisting**

```json
{
  "components": {
    "schemas": {
      "UserProfile": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "id":   { "type": "string", "x-data-classification": "internal_id" },
          "email":{ "type": "string", "format": "email", "x-data-classification": "pii" }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**File uploads**

* Size caps, MIME sniff + allowlist, AV scan, **re-encode images**, signed URLs with TTL under 5 minutes and content-type binding.

**Queues and events**

* Auth + TLS on Redis or Kafka, per-topic ACLs, **schema validation** for JSON events, dedupe keys, DLQ ACLs and PII scrubbing.

**Kubernetes and cloud**

* IMDSv2 only, IRSA for pods, admission policies (no root, read-only FS, drop caps), signed images (cosign), block unscanned images, egress allowlists.

## 7) Dark-Web and Credential Leak Auto-Reset

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant Feeds as HIBP DeHashed SpyCloud
  participant Norm as Normalizer
  participant Dir as Directory employees providers
  participant IdP as SSO MFA
  participant Jira as Jira On call

  Feeds-->>Norm: leaked email hash breach source timestamp
  Norm->>Dir: match emails fuzzy
  Dir-->>Norm: user ids
  Norm->>IdP: force reset revoke tokens
  IdP-->>Jira: ticket notify user audit trail
```

**Why it matters:** Hunters love credential stuffing. If an employee or privileged user reuses a breached password, you want the reset **before** they probe you.

---

## 8) Pre-IPO Seven-Day Hardening Plan

* **Day 0–1**: Freeze risky internet-facing changes. WAF to **block** for OWASP rules. Tight rate limits on login, OTP, reset. Enable **HSTS** and a strict **CSP**. Review CORS.
* **Day 1–2**: Exposure sweep with Censys or Shodan plus SG audits. Close **all dashboards** from the internet. S3 public audit. Verify Redis and Kafka **TLS + auth**.
* **Day 2–3**: Org-wide secret scans and rotations. Revoke unused OAuth apps. Enforce **MFA** across the org.
* **Day 3–4**: Mobile pass—MobSF clean, pinning verified, release flags only, remove debug toggles.
* **Day 4–5**: **IDOR pass** on top 20 endpoints for bookings, payments, addresses, profiles. Add missing owner checks.
* **Day 5–6**: Bug-bounty **surge desk**: on-call rota, pre-approved hotfix playbook, comms templates, takedown decision tree.
* **Day 6–7**: Red-team smoke tests. Lock dashboards. Exec readout: risk register with owner and dates.

---

## 9) What We Track (Metrics and Alerts)

* **External exposure**: new open ports or domains compared to baseline—**page on call** if critical.
* **PII drift**: responses returning fields **not** in the spec.
* **Auth abuse**: login or OTP failure spikes by IP and ASN; geo anomalies.
* **Leak watch**: new employee matches in breach feeds and reset status.
* **Mobile risk**: top MobSF issues by app version and market rollout.

---

## 10) Team Workflow: PR Template and SLAs

**PR checklist for internet-facing changes**

* [ ] AuthZ explicit and tested (owner checks)
* [ ] Per-route rate limit and idempotency where relevant
* [ ] Request **and response** validated against OpenAPI
* [ ] No secrets in code or logs
* [ ] PII fields reviewed and masked where needed
* [ ] File handling safe (MIME, size, AV, re-encode)
* [ ] No new public ingress or dashboards

**SLAs**: Critical 24h • High 3d • Medium 7d. Every alert links to a **runbook** with reproduction and a safe rollback.

---

## 11) Governance, Legal, and Ethics

* Respect robots and TOS where applicable; do not purchase stolen data.
* Store **only the necessary** breach indicators (e.g., hashed emails).
* Keep raw leak artifacts in restricted buckets; document processing in a Record of Processing.

---

## Closing

IPO-ready security is **not** a tooling contest—it’s **good defaults** plus **honest telemetry**.
If the platform makes secure the easiest way to ship, and your pipeline **catches drift** the moment it appears, you’ll be calmer than the hunters on the outside.
