I’m a **Software Engineer & Security Architect** who treats engineering as both a science and a craft.  
Much of my learning is self-directed—rooted in curiosity, first-principles reasoning, and a bias for action.  
My range runs from **C/C++ and systems internals** to **distributed cloud platforms** shaped by clear purpose and careful edges.  
I design for **graceful change**: secure by default, legible to the next reader, and stable where it matters.  

Security isn’t a bolt-on; it’s a **property that emerges from sound design**.  
I favor **precise contracts and clear seams**, least-privilege by habit, encrypted data paths, strong invariants, bounded blast radius, and **runtime enforcement** where the work actually happens—so data stays guarded and failure stays local.

## How I think
- **Purpose before parts.** Aristotle called it *telos*: build toward a clear end. In practice—name the objective, then choose the mechanism.  
- **First principles over fashion.** Reduce to essentials, state assumptions, prove the edges, and keep interfaces honest.  
- **Cause, signal, feedback.** Think in incentives and constraints; update beliefs when the evidence moves.  
- **Resilience → antifragility.** Design for safe failure and fast recovery; let stress refine the system rather than fracture it.  
- **Stewardship.** Leave things simpler, safer, and clearer than you found them.

## What I work on
- **Platform & Cloud Security** — trust boundaries, identity and network segmentation, encryption by default, policy-as-code, and telemetry that tells the truth.  
- **Secure-by-Design SDLC** — threat models tied to requirements, IaC baselines, secrets/SAST/SCA/IaC gates, golden images, patch pipelines, and boring rollbacks.  
- **Runtime Defense & Observability** — least privilege, provenance, syscall-level signals; incident response that favors containment over heroics.  
- **Systems that age well** — code and platforms that are easy to reason about, safe to change, and aligned with intent.  
- **Data protection & privacy** — minimized collection, scoped access, auditable flows, and deletion that actually deletes.

## Beyond Work
I’m a **bibliophile** drawn to classic literature, ancient wisdom and Greko-Indian thought, mathematics, psychology, and systems thinking.  
Thucydides, Dostoevsky sit beside CLRS, SICP, and Taleb—reminders that patterns repeat and feedback loops decide  endures.  

Sport keeps me disciplined: football, gym training, swimming, and long rides.  
Pacing and recovery matter in bodies and in systems; both reward consistency over theatrics.

## Core principles
**Ownership.** If it touches the user, it’s mine.  
**First principles.** Start from what must be true; earn the rest.  
**Bias for action.** Small steps, fast feedback, reversible by design.  
**Simplicity.** Reduce surfaces; clarify intent; name the invariants.  
**Antifragility.** Let stress inform the design and improve the defaults.  
**Stewardship.** Build with care; leave the system better than you found it. -->

## Toward Agentic Systems
Soon we'll be building **Emergent Actors**, not oracles. With agency comes duty: make intent legible, bound impact, and keep causation based feedback in loop.  
Alignment in practice means **clear objectives, calibrated incentives, and corrigible behavior**—systems that update based on secure inference, accept oversight, and **fail safely** when the world surprises us.  
That’s the bridge between research ideals and production reality: **alignment you can deploy**.
