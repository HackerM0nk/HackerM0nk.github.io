<div class="about-intro">
  <p class="lead">I'm a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> and <strong>Security Architect</strong> with a passion for building systems that are both resilient and elegant.</p>
</div>

<div class="about-content">
  <div class="philosophy-grid">
    <div class="philosophy-card">
      <h3>🎯 Disciplined Craft</h3>
      <p>I treat engineering as disciplined craft—first principles, careful trade-offs, and evidence that dictates actions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="philosophy-card">
      <h3>🚀 First Principles Learning</h3>
      <p>Much of my learning is self-directed—rooted in curiosity, first-principles reasoning, and a bias for action. My range runs from C/C++ and system internals to distributed cloud platforms.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="philosophy-card">
      <h3>🔒 Security by Design</h3>
      <p>Security isn't a bolt-on; it's a property that emerges from sound design. I favor bounded contexts, explicit trust boundaries, and runtime policy enforcement.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

## How I think
- **Purpose before parts** (Telos) Name the objective; choose mechanisms that serve it. 
- **Evidence-driven iteration** Define intent; measure what matters; adapt on evidence.  
- **Resilience → Antifragility** Make failure safe and recovery routine; let stress refine the defaults.  
- **Stewardship** Leave systems simpler, safer, clearer than you found them. -->

## What I Work On

<div class="work-areas">
  <div class="work-card">
    <div class="work-icon">🏗️</div>
    <h3>Platform & Cloud Security</h3>
    <p>Trust boundaries, identity & network segmentation, encryption by default, policy-as-code, telemetry that tells the truth.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="work-card">
    <div class="work-icon">🔄</div>
    <h3>Secure-by-Design SDLC</h3>
    <p>Threat models tied to requirements, IaC baselines, gates for secrets/SAST/SCA/IaC, golden images, patch pipelines, boring rollbacks.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="work-card">
    <div class="work-icon">📊</div>
    <h3>Runtime Observability</h3>
    <p>Least privilege, provenance, actionable signals; incident response that favors containment over heroics.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="work-card">
    <div class="work-icon">🛡️</div>
    <h3>Data Protection & Privacy</h3>
    <p>Minimized collection, scoped access, auditable flows, deletion that actually deletes.</p>
  </div>
</div>

    <h2>🤖 Toward Agentic Systems</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="philosophy-content">
    <p>We're building <strong>Emergent Actors</strong>, not oracles. With agency comes responsibility: When we grant a system agency, we also inherit the duty to make its intent clear, set boundaries on its course of action and preserve causal feedback loops so actions remain grounded in reality.</p>

    <p>Alignment, in practice, is about setting clear objectives and fostering corrigible behavior — systems that update on new evidence, accept oversight without resistance, and disengage safely when confronted with unforeseen circumstances.</p>
