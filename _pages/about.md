I’m a **Software Engineer** and **Security Architect**.  

- I treat engineering as **disciplined craft**—first principles, careful trade-offs, and evidence that dictates actions.

- Much of my learning is self-directed—rooted in curiosity, first-principles reasoning, and a bias for action. My range runs from C/C++ and system internals to distributed cloud platforms shaped by clear purpose and careful constraints.

- Security isn’t a bolt-on; it’s a **property that emerges from sound design**.  

- I favor bounded contexts with validated inputs, explicit trust boundaries, least-privilege, deny-by-default access, encrypted data paths, and runtime policy enforcement — so protection is continuous and failure stays local.

## How I think
- **Purpose before parts** (Telos) Name the objective; choose mechanisms that serve it. 
- **Evidence-driven iteration** Define intent; measure what matters; adapt on evidence.  
- **Resilience → Antifragility** Make failure safe and recovery routine; let stress refine the defaults.  
- **Stewardship** Leave systems simpler, safer, clearer than you found them. -->

## What I work on
- **Platform & Cloud Security** — trust boundaries, identity & network segmentation, encryption by default, policy-as-code, telemetry that tells the truth.  
- **Secure-by-Design SDLC** — threat models tied to requirements, IaC baselines, gates for secrets/SAST/SCA/IaC, golden images, patch pipelines, boring rollbacks.  
- **Runtime Observability** — least privilege, provenance, actionable signals; incident response that favors containment over heroics.  
- **Data Protection, Privacy and Compliance** — minimized collection, scoped access, auditable flows, deletion that actually deletes.

## Beyond Work
- I’m a **bibliophile** drawn to classic literature, ancient Greek and Indian thought, mathematics, psychology, and systems thinking. 

- Thucydides and Dostoevsky sit beside CLRS, SICP and GEB — reminders that patterns repeat and feedback loops decide what endures.

- Sport keeps me disciplined: football, gym training, long walks and rides.  
Pacing and recovery matter in bodies and in systems; both reward consistency over theatrics.

## Toward Agentic Systems
- We’re building **Emergent Actors**, not oracles. With agency comes duty: make intent legible, bound impact, and keep causal feedback in the loop.  

- Alignment in practice means clear objectives and corrigible behavior — systems that update on evidence, accept oversight, and fail safely when the world surprises us.
